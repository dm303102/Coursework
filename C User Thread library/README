In this last project, you will start with a skeleton of a preemptive user-level thread library
under the SOLARIS operating system. The skeleton library contains a set of basic thread
management functions. You will add several functions to the existing skeleton to
complete a preemptive user-level thread.
The library will consist of a set of functions that allow management of threads in user
space (i.e., the operating system is not aware of your threads) according to a many-to-one
model. These functions will allow the creation, termination, and synchronization of
threads, as well as setting the scheduling policy.
