// Description: README file for Intal_Interp program
//
// The Intal_Interp.cc program reads and interprets
// commands from the low-level language Intal. Commands include
// ADDR var addr, SET var val, INCR var, DECR var, ADD || SUB
// || MULT || DIV on var var and PRINT var. The program takes
// one command line parameter that is a flag to determine the
// STL algorithm to use in implementing the sybmol_table for the
// Intal interpreter. These inlude -h(hash_map), -m(map) and
// -l(list). The interpreter accepts multiple bindings by using
// another multimap structure to map an address
// (range: 0-50,000) to a set of variable strings. These strings
// are referenced and updated every time a variable with the same
// address is updated. The STL data structures implementing the
// table are composed of string key to represent variables and
// a struct defined below called binding as the data which holds
// an integer address and an integer value.
//
// The -l option works up until access of the elements in the list. I
// can't figure it out. The list objects are found and update by an
// iterator, but when I tried to output them, I got junk.
